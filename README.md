This repository is for trigger-word detection/ digit recognition in speech using recurrent neural networks


Trigger word/ wake word detection is one of the most common applications of sequence models. The goal is to detect instances when a certain word is uttered, and more often than not, recognise the said word from amongst a small pool of "wake words"

In this repository, I demonstrate a GRU network, in combination with 1D Convolution, to detect three words:

**One, Two and Three**
